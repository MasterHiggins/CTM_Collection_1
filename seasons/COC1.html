        Chris' Taskmaster Champion of Champions, the original, would air to be the most prestigious and hyped season of the show, minus The Finale.
        After two months of hype, the original roster of the show, Sterling, David, and Fisher, would return to face off against one another to determine
        the ultimate winner. However, there was a twist, as Down also returned due to the tie. After a long 8 hours, Down was crowned the winner against 
        David with 8 more points, and Sterling getting tied with Fisher for last.
