        Chris' Taskmaster All Stars saw the return of every contestant in Set 1, Sterling, Fisher, David, Down, and Tyler. A shorter, 8 task, 2 photo
        task, and prize task, season to end the year and the set as a whole. After a season focused more on laughs than competition, Down was declared the 
        winner, with David in second, Sterling in third, Fisher in fourth, and Tyler a distant fifth.
