        Chris' Taskmaster 3 would see Down, Fisher, and newcomer Tyler Higgins make their way to one more shot at being in Champion of Champions.
        After a hard fought season, Fisher would narrowly win against the others, beating Tyler by one point, and Down by three. This would be the 
        last season until Champion of Champions a gruelling 2 months later.
