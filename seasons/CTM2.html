        Chris' Taskmaster 2 saw the return of David and Fisher, with newcomer Michael Down taking place in the spot left unfilled by
        Sterling's win, barring him from future seasons until Champion of Champions. In the end, the season was originallt declared a 
        tie, with David getting a bonus point for his intro efforts, but later it was changed to a joint victory between David and 
        Down, with Fisher getting a slightly distant third place.
